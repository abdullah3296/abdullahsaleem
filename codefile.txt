Brief Description:
In this project, the goal is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (cancel their subscription) for a telecom company. By analyzing historical customer data, the project aims to provide insights that can help the company take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rate.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data, including demographic information, usage patterns, call records, billing details, and customer service interactions.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the collected data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations to make it suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough exploration of the data to gain insights into customer behavior, identify patterns, and understand factors that contribute to churn.

Feature Selection and Engineering: Select the most relevant features from the dataset and create new features if needed to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Building: Develop and train a machine learning model using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to predict customer churn.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tune the model parameters if necessary.

Deployment and Implementation: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, deploy it into a production environment where it can be used to predict customer churn in real-time.

Interpretation and Recommendations: Analyze the model's predictions and provide actionable insights to the telecom company, suggesting strategies to reduce customer churn and improve customer retention.

By successfully implementing this project, the telecom company can proactively identify customers at risk of churn, enabling them to take targeted actions to retain those customers and potentially improve their overall business performance.
